# Randomly generated secret with Secret Manager for Terraform

> NOTE: This module is for Terraform 0.13 - use 0.12.x releases for Terraform 0.12

This sub-module provides the same variables and capabilities as the base Secret
Manager module, but will generate a random password to use as the secret value.
Additional fields can be used to customise the password generator.

E.g. to create and store a random alphanumeric password of 8 chars that
*excludes* special characters:

```hcl
module "password" {
  source = "activeops-io/terraform-secrets-manager//modules/random"
  version = "1.0.1"
  project_id = "my-project-id"
  id = "my-secret"
  # By default, random secret value will include 16 uppercase,lowercase, numbers,
  # and special characters; let's change that for the legacy app which can only
  # accept 8 alphanumeric chars.
  length = 8
  has_special_chars = false
}
```

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| terraform | ~> 0.13 |
| google | ~> 3.44 |

## Providers

| random | n/a |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| accessors | An optional list of IAM account identifiers that will be granted accessor (read-only)<br>permission to the secret. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| has\_lower\_chars | Include lowercase alphabet characters in the generated secret. Default is true;<br>set to false to exclude generating a secret containing lowercase characters. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| has\_numeric\_chars | Include numeric characters in the generated secret. Default is true;<br>set to false to exclude generating a secret containing numeric characters. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| has\_special\_chars | Include special characters in the generated secret. Default is true;<br>set to false to exclude generating a secret containing special characters. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| has\_upper\_chars | Include uppercase alphabet characters in the generated secret. Default is true;<br>set to false to exclude generating a secret containing uppercase characters. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| id | The secret identifier to create; this value must be unique within the project. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| labels | An optional map of label key:value pairs to assign to the secret resources.<br>Default is an empty map. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| length | The length of the random string to generate for secret value. Default is 16. | `number` | `16` | no |
| min\_lower\_chars | The minimum number of lowercase characters to include in the generated secret.<br>Default is 0, which allows the randomiser logic to exclude lowercase characters<br>if needed to satisfy other `min_` rules. Note that setting to 0 will not<br>guarantee lowercase characters will be excluded - set `has_lower_chars` to false<br>to exclude lowercase characters from generated secret. | `number` | `0` | no |
| min\_numeric\_chars | The minimum number of numeric characters to include in the generated secret.<br>Default is 0, which allows the randomiser logic to exclude numeric characters<br>if needed to satisfy other `min_` rules. Note that setting to 0 will not<br>guarantee numeric characters will be excluded - set `has_numeric_chars` to false<br>to exclude numeric characters from generated secret. | `number` | `0` | no |
| min\_special\_chars | The minimum number of special characters to include in the generated secret.<br>Default is 0, which allows the randomiser logic to exclude special characters<br>if needed to satisfy other `min_` rules. Note that setting to 0 will not<br>guarantee special characters will be excluded - set `has_special_chars` to false<br>to exclude special characters from generated secret. | `number` | `0` | no |
| min\_upper\_chars | The minimum number of uppercase characters to include in the generated secret.<br>Default is 0, which allows the randomiser logic to exclude uppercase characters<br>if needed to satisfy other `min_` rules. Note that setting to 0 will not<br>guarantee uppercase characters will be excluded - set `has_upper_chars` to false<br>to exclude uppercase characters from generated secret. | `number` | `0` | no |
| project\_id | The GCP project identifier where the secret will be created. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| replication\_locations | An optional list of replication locations for the secret. If the value is an<br>empty list (default) then an automatic replication policy will be applied. Use<br>this if you must have replication constrained to specific locations.<br><br>E.g. to use automatic replication policy (default)<br>replication\_locations = []<br><br>E.g. to force secrets to be replicated only in us-east1 and us-west1 regions:<br>replication\_locations = [ "us-east1", "us-west1" ] | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| special\_char\_set | Override the 'special' characters used by Terraform's random\_string provider to<br>the set provided. Default is the same set as used by Terraform by default. | `string` | `"!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | The fully-qualified id of the Secret Manager key that contains the secret. |
| secret\_id | The project-local id Secret Manager key that contains the secret. Should match<br>the input `id`. |
